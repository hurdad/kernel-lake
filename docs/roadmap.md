# KernelLake roadmap

Status as of the last update to this file. "Done" means built, compiled,
and covered by passing tests -- not merely designed or stubbed.

## Done

- Repository scaffolding, root CMake configuration, `CMakePresets.json`
  (`dev` / `release` / `gpu-dev`)
- Error hierarchy, strongly typed identifiers, minimal CLI skeleton
- YAML configuration loading and validation, spdlog-based logging
- Internal type system (`TypeId`/`DataType`/`Schema`) with Arrow adapters
- Typed expression tree (columns, literals, binary/unary ops, `CAST`,
  `BETWEEN`, aggregates)
- SQL parsing (vendored `hyrise/sql-parser`, MIT, pinned commit) with a
  `read_parquet(...)` syntax adapter and a parser-independent AST
- Binder / type checker: column resolution, aggregate/`GROUP BY`
  validation, safe implicit numeric casts
- Logical plan nodes with human-readable and JSON `EXPLAIN` output
- Rule-based optimizer: constant folding, boolean simplification, `BETWEEN`
  simplification, adjacent-filter combination, trivial-filter removal,
  redundant-projection removal, `LIMIT` pushdown, projection/predicate
  pushdown annotations
- Local object store (`LocalObjectStore`) and file discovery (single file,
  glob, directory; deterministic ordering; explicit errors on missing paths)
- Real Parquet metadata inspection (schema, row groups, column statistics)
  and row-group/file pruning against actual min/max statistics
- Physical plan nodes and the physical planner (`LogicalPlan` + pruning ->
  `PhysicalPlan`), including remapping `ColumnExpression` indices above the
  scan to the narrowed (projection-pushed-down) physical schema
- GPU dependency vendoring (`cmake/ThirdPartyRapids.cmake`): libcudf, RMM,
  kvikio, nvcomp, and rapids-logger fetched from pinned PyPI wheels, no
  conda
- `ExecutionContext`, `DeviceBatch`, the Arrow<->cudf C-Data-Interface
  bridge, RAII CUDA device/stream wrappers, and RMM memory-pool/statistics/
  limit configuration (`kernellake_memory`, `kernellake_execution`)
- Every GPU operator the MVP query needs: `ParquetScanOperator`,
  `FilterOperator`, `ProjectionOperator`, `ScalarAggregateOperator`
  (cross-batch via `cudf::reduce`'s `init` param), `HashAggregateOperator`
  (cross-batch via `cudf::groupby::streaming_groupby`, bounded by
  `max_distinct_keys`), `LimitOperator`, `ArrowResultOperator` -- see
  "GPU operators" in `docs/architecture.md` for the two correctness
  bugs (STRING columns through `cudf::ast`, and scan column-index
  remapping) this surfaced and fixed
- `QueryEngine::execute()`, wired to the real operator pipeline for
  `gpu-dev` builds (a CPU-only stub throws `ExecutionError` for `dev`
  builds), and the `kernellake query` CLI command (`--sql`/`--file`,
  `--format table|csv|jsonl|arrow`, `--output`, `--stats`) -- **the spec's
  required initial deliverable now runs end-to-end and has been verified
  on real GPU hardware**
- `kernellake generate-data`: deterministic synthetic dataset generator
  (`order_id`/`customer_id`/`region`/`amount`/`event_date`/`event_time`/
  `category`/`discount`), configurable row/file/row-group count,
  cardinality, null rate, skew, and seed; CPU-only, no CUDA dependency
- DuckDB cross-validation tooling (`tools/validate_against_duckdb.py`):
  runs the same SQL through `kernellake query --format arrow` and DuckDB
  reading the same Parquet files, compares results. Verified passing for
  filter/projection, scalar aggregates (SUM/COUNT/AVG/MIN/MAX), grouped
  aggregates (including high-cardinality `GROUP BY`), and `COUNT` over a
  nullable column

## Not yet started

- Broader integration-test coverage beyond `tools/validate_against_duckdb.py`
  (dictionary-encoded strings, multiple files with mismatched row-group
  layouts, larger-than-single-execution-batch datasets exercised under
  test rather than only manually)
- TPC-H tooling: `tools/generate_tpch.py`, `benchmarks/tpch/queries/*.sql`,
  `kernellake validate tpch`, `kernellake benchmark tpch` (Q6 first, then
  Q1)
- Docker images (`docker/Dockerfile.dev`, `docker/Dockerfile.runtime`)
- GitHub Actions CI (CPU-safe checks split from CUDA compile checks and GPU
  runtime tests)
- `NOTICE` / `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, `clang-format`/`clang-tidy` config

## Explicit non-goals for the MVP

Distributed execution, multi-node/multi-GPU scheduling, Kubernetes
operators, full Iceberg catalog integration, Arrow Flight SQL, joins, all
22 TPC-H queries, cost-based optimization, fault-tolerant fragment
retries, query spilling, materialized views, transactions, data ingestion
(`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`), a proprietary storage format, and a web UI.
Interfaces may exist for some of these (see "Future architecture" in
`docs/architecture.md`) but none are implemented or exposed as supported
features.
