# KernelLake roadmap

Status as of the last update to this file. "Done" means built, compiled,
and covered by passing tests -- not merely designed or stubbed.

## Done

- Repository scaffolding, root CMake configuration, `CMakePresets.json`
  (`dev` / `release` / `gpu-dev`)
- Error hierarchy, strongly typed identifiers, minimal CLI skeleton
- YAML configuration loading and validation, spdlog-based logging
- Internal type system (`TypeId`/`DataType`/`Schema`) with Arrow adapters
- Typed expression tree (columns, literals, binary/unary ops, `CAST`,
  `BETWEEN`, aggregates)
- SQL parsing (vendored `hyrise/sql-parser`, MIT, pinned commit) with a
  `read_parquet(...)` syntax adapter and a parser-independent AST
- Binder / type checker: column resolution, aggregate/`GROUP BY`
  validation, safe implicit numeric casts
- Logical plan nodes with human-readable and JSON `EXPLAIN` output
- Rule-based optimizer: constant folding, boolean simplification, `BETWEEN`
  simplification, adjacent-filter combination, trivial-filter removal,
  redundant-projection removal, `LIMIT` pushdown, projection/predicate
  pushdown annotations
- Local object store (`LocalObjectStore`) and file discovery (single file,
  glob, directory; deterministic ordering; explicit errors on missing paths)
- Real Parquet metadata inspection (schema, row groups, column statistics)
  and row-group/file pruning against actual min/max statistics
- Physical plan nodes and the physical planner (`LogicalPlan` + pruning ->
  `PhysicalPlan`), including remapping `ColumnExpression` indices above the
  scan to the narrowed (projection-pushed-down) physical schema
- GPU dependency vendoring (`cmake/ThirdPartyRapids.cmake`): libcudf, RMM,
  kvikio, nvcomp, and rapids-logger fetched from pinned PyPI wheels, no
  conda
- `ExecutionContext`, `DeviceBatch`, the Arrow<->cudf C-Data-Interface
  bridge, RAII CUDA device/stream wrappers, and RMM memory-pool/statistics/
  limit configuration (`kernellake_memory`, `kernellake_execution`)
- Every GPU operator the MVP query needs: `ParquetScanOperator`,
  `FilterOperator`, `ProjectionOperator`, `ScalarAggregateOperator`
  (cross-batch via `cudf::reduce`'s `init` param), `HashAggregateOperator`
  (cross-batch via `cudf::groupby::streaming_groupby`, bounded by
  `max_distinct_keys`), `LimitOperator`, `ArrowResultOperator` -- see
  "GPU operators" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the two correctness
  bugs (STRING columns through `cudf::ast`, and scan column-index
  remapping) this surfaced and fixed
- `ORDER BY` execution: `SortOperator` (`cudf::stable_sorted_order` +
  `cudf::gather`, blocking), on both plain queries and after `GROUP BY`
  (scoped to a SELECT-list output name -- see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
  Surfaced and fixed two more latent physical-planner bugs in the process:
  `LogicalProjection`'s and `LogicalSort`'s conversion both unconditionally
  remapped their expressions against the scan schema, which is wrong for
  the aggregate-reprojection/post-aggregation-sort case (their expressions
  already reference the aggregate's own output schema) -- previously
  masked because every prior test happened to hit the case where the
  optimizer removes the redundant reprojection entirely. Verified against
  DuckDB for the surviving-reprojection case.
- `QueryEngine::execute()`, wired to the real operator pipeline for
  `gpu-dev` builds (a CPU-only stub throws `ExecutionError` for `dev`
  builds), and the `kernellake query` CLI command (`--sql`/`--file`,
  `--format table|csv|jsonl|arrow`, `--output`, `--stats`) -- **the spec's
  required initial deliverable now runs end-to-end and has been verified
  on real GPU hardware**
- `kernellake generate-data`: deterministic synthetic dataset generator
  (`order_id`/`customer_id`/`region`/`amount`/`event_date`/`event_time`/
  `category`/`discount`), configurable row/file/row-group count,
  cardinality, null rate, skew, and seed; CPU-only, no CUDA dependency
- DuckDB cross-validation tooling (`tools/validate_against_duckdb.py`):
  runs the same SQL through `kernellake query --format arrow` and DuckDB
  reading the same Parquet files, compares results. Verified passing for
  filter/projection, scalar aggregates (SUM/COUNT/AVG/MIN/MAX), grouped
  aggregates (including high-cardinality `GROUP BY`), and `COUNT` over a
  nullable column

- TPC-H tooling (`lineitem`-only -- Q6 and Q1, both single-table; Q3/Q12/Q14
  need hash joins, not implemented yet): `tools/generate_tpch.py` (synthetic
  generator, not real `dbgen`), `benchmarks/tpch/queries/{q01,q06}.sql`,
  `tools/validate_tpch.py` (DuckDB cross-validation; the spec's `kernellake
  validate tpch` as a Python tool rather than a CLI subcommand, same choice
  as `validate_against_duckdb.py`), and `kernellake benchmark tpch`
  (cold/warm modes with median/mean/min/max/stddev over configurable
  iterations; `execution-only` mode is not implemented -- see
  `docs/TPCH.md`). Verified: Q1 and Q6 both match DuckDB at SF0.01 and
  SF0.1.

- `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0), `NOTICE`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` (every
  dependency actually declared in the build, verified against each
  package's own license metadata rather than assumed -- including flagging
  that the CUDA Toolkit and RAPIDS's vendored `nvcomp` component are
  NVIDIA proprietary SDK/EULA dependencies, not open source)
- `.clang-format` (the whole existing C++ tree has been reformatted to
  match and is currently clean); `.clang-tidy` config, spot-checked with a
  real `clang-tidy-18` run against a compiled source file (one real finding,
  34,609 non-user-code warnings correctly suppressed by `HeaderFilterRegex`)
  but not run across the whole tree and not wired into CI yet; optional
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (clang-format only)
- `docker/Dockerfile` (single file, multi-stage, two named targets:
  `dev` -- full CUDA devel image with the repo built inside it -- and
  `runtime` -- only the built binary plus its actual non-system runtime
  dependency closure, resolved via `ldd` rather than hard-coded vendored
  paths) and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, one workflow with four jobs in
  dependency order: `format-check` and `cpu-build-test` (parallel,
  CPU-only build+test on the `dev` preset) -> `tpch-tooling-smoke`
  (`needs: cpu-build-test`; small-scale `generate_tpch.py` run plus
  `kernellake explain` -- not `query` -- against both query files) ->
  `docker-publish` (`needs:` all three, `if: github.event_name !=
  'pull_request'`; builds both `docker/Dockerfile` targets and pushes
  them to `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:dev` and `:runtime`/`:latest` using
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`). **Confirmed on real GitHub Actions infrastructure**
  (run `30718829266`, 2026-08-01): all four jobs succeeded end to end,
  including `docker-publish` (~10 minutes, no runner-disk issues) --
  both images are live at `ghcr.io/hurdad/kernel-lake:dev`/`:runtime`/
  `:latest`. Cross-workflow `needs:` isn't a GitHub Actions feature, which
  is why this is one file rather than a separate docker-publish.yml
  gated some other way. GPU-dependent work (the `gpu-dev` preset,
  `tests/gpu/`, real query execution, DuckDB validation, TPC-H
  benchmarks) is intentionally not in this workflow -- standard
  GitHub-hosted runners have no GPU, and a skipped-GPU job must never be
  reported as passing; that needs a self-hosted GPU runner, not
  configured here (see "Not yet started")

- `tests/gpu/multi_batch_integration_test.cpp`: dictionary-encoded vs. plain
  string columns, two files with deliberately mismatched row-group layouts
  (3 row groups of 100 rows vs. 1 row group of 250 rows), and a forced
  multi-pass `ParquetScanOperator` (a 256-byte `pass_read_limit_bytes`
  against ~550 rows' worth of data) -- one test proves the scan genuinely
  emits more than 2 batches under these settings (not just 1-per-file),
  another runs the real `build_physical_plan` + `build_operator_tree`
  pipeline (the same one `QueryEngine::execute()` uses) end-to-end across
  those same conditions and checks the grouped sums/counts by hand

## Not yet started

- TPC-H `execution-only` benchmark mode (needs an operator-tree entry point
  that skips `ParquetScanOperator`); TPC-H at real SF1/SF10 scale (only
  tested at SF0.01/SF0.1 so far); Q3/Q12/Q14 (need hash joins)
- A self-hosted GPU CI runner (would enable a `gpu-dev` build/test/
  benchmark/validate workflow to actually run in CI, rather than only
  locally) -- explicitly deferred; `hurdad/kernel-lake` is a public repo,
  and a self-hosted runner must never be reachable from `pull_request`
  events (only `push` to `main`, after review) or an outside contributor
  gets code execution on the runner's owner's hardware
- Running `clang-tidy` across the whole tree and wiring it into CI (config
  spot-checked, not exhaustively run)
- `docker run --gpus all` of the published `runtime` image against a real
  GPU (the image builds and pushes successfully in CI; actually running it
  hasn't been checked yet)

## Explicit non-goals for the MVP

Distributed execution, multi-node/multi-GPU scheduling, Kubernetes
operators, full Iceberg catalog integration, Arrow Flight SQL, joins, all
22 TPC-H queries, cost-based optimization, fault-tolerant fragment
retries, query spilling, materialized views, transactions, data ingestion
(`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`), a proprietary storage format, and a web UI.
Interfaces may exist for some of these (see "Future architecture" in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) but none are implemented or exposed as supported
features.
